Getting Started
===============

This section of the documentation describes, in order, how to install starfish, gives a brief
overview of starfish's data model and its expectations for how data is formatted, provides an
example of how to use starfish's tools to construct the index used by starfish to interact with
image data, provides instructions on loading and visualizing data, and jumps into a worked example
of constructing and applying an example data processing pipeline.

# TODO ambrosejcarr: needs a comparison between smFISH and multiplex methods, otherwise later
#                    statements don't make any sense.

The following section
:ref:`Creating an Image Processing Pipeline <creating_an_image_processing_pipeline>`
goes into each of these sections in more detail.

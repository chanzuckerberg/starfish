Plotting Utilities
==================

This module contains a series of utilities for creating two dimensional plots that are useful for
generating documentation and vignettes. We suggest that users leverage :py:func:`starfish.display`
for their plotting needs, as the interactive viewer is better able to handle the array of features
that starfish needs.

.. code-block:: python

    from starfish.util import plot

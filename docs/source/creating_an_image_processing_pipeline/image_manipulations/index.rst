ImageStack Manipulations
========================

Starfish provides simple image manipulation tools to support indexing, slicing, and projection
of data stored in :ref:`ImageStack` objects.

Cropping
========

Starfish offers several options for cropping image data, both out-of-memory on load and in-memory.
These can be useful for (1) restricting the size of a large image to load on demand and (2) removing
edge effects after image processing approaches have been applied.

Crop on Load
------------

# TODO write a vignette on crop-on-load

Selecting Images
----------------

# TODO write a vignette on using :code:`sel`

Projection
==========

# TODO write a vignette on projection using starfish (can these vignettes be made with gallery and
in-lined?

SpaceTx Consortium
==================

The SpaceTx consortium is a group led by Ed Lein and the Allen Institute for Brain Science that
is engaged in benchmarking image-based transcriptomics assays. In collaboration with the lead
developers of 10 image-based transcriptomics assays, they are applying each technology to adjacent
sections of mouse and human primary visual cortex. The goal of this experiment is to understand
what assay(s) are best applied to (a) spatially localizing cells by type based on marker genes and
(b) obtaining robust phenotypes of cells by measuring RNA from thousands of genes.

Consortium members include:

Ed Boyden, MIT
Long Cai, Caltech
Fei Chen, Broad Institute
Karl Dieserroth, Stanford
Ed Lein, Allen Institute for Brain Science
Sten Linnarrson, Karolinska Institutet
Joakim Lundeberg, SciLifeLab

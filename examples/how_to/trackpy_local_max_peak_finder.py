Finding Spots with :py:class:`.TrackpyLocalMaxPeakFinder`
=========================================================

RNA FISH spots are usually bright point spread functions in a greyscale image.
:term:`Rolonies<Rolony>`, which are rolling-circle amplicons produced in certain assays (e.g. in
situ sequencing), are approximately 1-um diameter Gaussian spots. Generally, the recommended
:py:class:`.FindSpotsAlgorithm` to use in a starfish pipeline is :py:class:`.BlobDetector`
because it accounts for the intensity profile of a spot rather than just thresholding pixel
values. But for some images :py:class:`.BlobDetector` may not be satisfactory so starfish also
provides alternatives.

:py:class:`.TrackpyLocalMaxPeakFinder` finds Gaussian spots by an implementation of the
Crocker-Grier centroid-finding algorithm. Local maxima are treated as centroids and then the
locations are refined to obtain sub-pixel accuracy. Unlike :py:class:`.LocalMaxPeakFinder`,
:py:class:`.TrackpyLocalMaxPeakFinder` measures spot attributes like size and eccentricity but it
also requires the user to manually set a minimum intensity threshold.

Before running :py:class:`.TrackpyLocalMaxPeakFinder`, the image must be preprocessed to
smooth noise and remove background. This can be done by setting ``preprocess=True`` or by running
:py:class:`.Bandpass` filter separately. If done in :py:class:`.TrackpyLocalMaxPeakFinder`,
``noise_size`` defines the width of the Gaussian blurring kernel for removing high frequency
noise and ``smoothing_size`` defines the width of boxcar smoothing kernel. There is no formula
for picking ``noise_size``, but larger values will lead to more blurring and it should be less
than ``smoothing_size``. And ``smoothing_size`` should generally be the diameter of a spot
rounded up to the nearest odd integer. The background should be set to zero with a ``threshold``
set in  :py:class:`.Bandpass` or by
ref:`clipping background to zero  <howto_clip_percentile_to_zero>`.

For finding spots, ``spot_diameter`` is used to identify all possible spots and should be set to
the diameter of the spots on zero background rounded up to the nearest odd integer. Then
thresholds such as ``min_mass`` (integrated brightness), ``max_size`` (radius of gyration),
``percentile`` (relative peak brightness), and ``separation`` (distance between spots) are used
to filter out spots. Plotting these attributes can help ballpark cutoff values but :ref:`visually
assessing <howto_spotfindingresults>` results is needed to validate the parameter settings before
running in batch.

.. warning::
    :py:class:`.TrackpyLocalMaxPeakFinder` does not support finding spots on
    independent 2D slices of a volume (i.e., ``is_volume = False``).

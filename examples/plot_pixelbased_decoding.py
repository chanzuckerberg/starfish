Pixel-Based Decoding
====================

Pixel-based decoding is the approach of localizing and :term:`decoding <Decoding>` molecules
(e.g. RNA transcripts or :term:`rolonies <Rolony>`) that does not rely on algorithms to find
spots by fitting Gaussian profiles or local intensity maxima. Instead of finding spots to be
decoded, it decodes every pixel and then connects potential pixels with the same
:term:`codeword <Codeword>` into spots. The strength of this approach is it works on dense data
and noisy data where spot finding algorithms have a hard time accurately detecting spots. The
weakness is that it is prone to false positives by decoding noise that would normally be ignored
by spot finding algorithms. That is why pixel-based decoding is better suited for error-robust
assays such as MERFISH where the :term:`codebook <Codebook>` is designed to filter out noise.

Unlike :ref:`tutorial_spot_based_decoding` that has a variety of classes and methods to customize a
workflow, pixel-based decoding is straight-forward and only requires one class in starfish:
:py:class:`.PixelSpotDecoder`. The only decoding algorithm option is the same as
:py:class:`.MetricDistance` but applied to each pixel. That means normalizing images is very
important for accurate decoding and it needs vector magnitude and distance thresholds. See
:ref:`howto_metricdistance` for more details.

After decoding pixels, :py:class:`.PixelSpotDecoder` combines connected  pixels into spots with
:py:func:`skimage.measure.label` and :py:func:`skimage.measure.regionprops`, which returns spot
locations and attributes. Spots that don't meet size thresholds ``min_area`` and ``max_area`` are
marked as not passing thresholds in the :py:class:`.DecodedIntensityTable`. In addition, the results
from connected component analysis that do not fit in the :py:class:`.DecodedIntensityTable` (e.g.
spot attributes and labeled images) are returned in a :py:class:`.ConnectedComponentDecodingResult`.

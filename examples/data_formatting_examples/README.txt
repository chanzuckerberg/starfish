Data Formatting Examples Using TileFetcher
------------------------------------------

There is currently no widely used standard data format for image-based microscopy data.
starfish works best when data is converted into the SpaceTx data format.
Here, we provide several examples of how to convert data from non-standardized data formats
into SpaceTx format from a variety of types of input data shapes and sizes, demonstrating the
flexibility of :py:class:`.TileFetcher`.

These examples are provided for illustrative purposes, demonstrating how the
:py:class:`.TileFetcher` is used in practice. They will need to be adapted to meet the specific needs of your data.

# Code of conduct


# How can I contribute?
## Reporting bugs

## Code contributions
- Don't break the build: pull requests are expected to pass all automated CI checks.

- All Pull Request comments must be addressed, even after merge.

- All code must be reviewed by at least 1 other team member.

## Notebook contributions
- All `.ipynb` files should have a corresponding `.py` file.  Use [nbencdec](https://github.com/ttung/nbencdec) to generate the corresponding `.py` file.
